# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing algorithm exercises on freeCodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't done algorithm exercises for many months, so it was really challenging. It seems like I have been using the same techniques and methods, so this is a great way to learn new things while getting my brain back to solve such exercises.

### Day 2: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another session of algorithms... Ended up in a forum topic called "I feel so stuck in the algorithm challenges"  and tightly-closed eyes At least there is only a way up from here 



### Day 3: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some improvements on my recently created page using unsplash API and React.   

Here is the result: https://imager.netlify.app


### Day 4: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**:Had a lot  more successful time with algorithms, and I actually enjoyed working on them. (As I actually managed to solve them this time.) Yaayy!!


### Day 5: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn Typescript, and did some basic exercises with it. Looking forward to the feeling when it all makes (more) sense


### Day 6:June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another session of learning the basics of Typescript. 


### Day 7: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with TypeScript basics. 
Hard to keep focused when it's such a nice summer day.


### Day 8: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about classes from a TypeScript perspective. 
Private, protected, static, abstract classes, get, set, etc... I wonder in what kind of project I will use them.

### Day 9: June 5, 2020
Learnt about namespaces, modules and interfaces (TS). 
However, it is still unclear how I will use TypeScript in a real project.

### Day 10: June 7, 2020

Learnt about Generics - Typescript.
