# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started doing algorithm exercises on freeCodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't done algorithm exercises for many months, so it was really challenging. It seems like I have been using the same techniques and methods, so this is a great way to learn new things while getting my brain back to solve such exercises.
